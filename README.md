CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION, # Free & Open Canvas for Humans and Machines

Grida is a Free & Open canvas for humans and machines. With grida you can

- Draw ideas with AI
- Visualize your data
- Build Apps without heavy coding
- Run a physics simulation

## Why?

**We believe graphics is the most powerful language that both humans and machines will appreciate.**

Over the years, we have been using different tools and languages to create and visualize our ideas. We heavily relied on programming languages, wich I personally think there is a better way to do this for both Humans and Machines. We wanted to create a tool that is easy to use, yet designed for AI collaboration from scratch. Grida is our answer to that.

## Contributing

Building Grida is hard, and the whole concept of Open & Free cannot be sustained without your help. We'd love to have you change the industry together.
